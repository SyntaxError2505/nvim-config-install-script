# Neovim Config Install Script
### Rolls right of the tongue. That's what you get for not getting a great name like Lazyvim
## Usage
Clone using git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SyntaxError2505/nvim-config-install-script.git
```
Cd into the cloned directory and run following command:
```bash
cat install.sh | sh
```
I would have a nice install command using curl like Rust or NPM but neither am I smart enough to set up an API nor rich enough to host it (:
